			</div>
			<div class="body-text">As a solo UX researcher and designer in this project, I am conducting
                competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping, and usability studies on my own.
			</div>

			<div></div>
			<div></div>

			<div class="header-text">Project Background and Overview</div>
			<div class="body-text">I really enjoy reading, and I wanted to create a simple mobile app that
                can easily organize books into a combined virtual bookshelf and journal.
			</div>
            <div class="body-text">The purpose of this project is primarily to explore higher level
                interactive Figma prototyping and serve as an exercise in conducting multiple iterations of usability studies.
			</div>

			<div></div>
			<div></div>

			<div class="header-text">Understanding Users</div>

			<div class="subheader-text">Qualitative Competitive Analysis</div>
			<div class="body-text">I conducted a competitive analysis of similar library management and reading tracker applications,
                including Bookshelf, libib, BookBuddy, and Goodreads.
			</div>
            <div class="body-text">As an overview, the key feature that direct competitors offered was the option of adding books to a
                list, using barcode scanning, manual searching or adding, and ISBN lookup. Other features across the both indirect and
                direct competitors included reviews, book and genre recommendations, and wishlists.
			</div>
            <div class="body-text">From these audits, I narrowed down two features to highlight in this design:
                <li>Personal Tags</li>
                <li>Custom Annotations/Notes</li>
			</div>

			<div></div>
			<div></div>

			<div class="header-text">UX Concept Design</div>
            <div class="subheader-text">Wireframing</div>

			<div class="body-text">I created hand drawn wireframes that served as a reference for the first iteration of a low fidelity
                prototype. It includes a bookshelf and expanded shelf section, a search function, settings, and various features in a
                book overview screen.

			<div class="header-text">Prototyping and Testing</div>
            <div class="body-text">I conducted three rounds of usability testing, developing more comprehensive prototyping
                and creating possible solutions to pain points that I discovered at every step. Every iteration was tested
                by different users.</div>

            <div class="header-text">First Iteration and Feedback</div>

			</div>

			<div></div>
			<div></div>

			<div class="body-text">Above is the basic layout of the wireframe as a base. The first iteration includes basic
                prototyped animations and flows, optimized for testing by providing feedback when specific tasks are completed.
                Try out the prototype in the interactive frame below.
			</div>

            <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="auto" height="500" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FsAradK6V0qPgQzsnjfFlo0%2Fdog-eared%3Fnode-id%3D49%253A365%26scaling%3Dscale-down%26page-id%3D9%253A10%26starting-point-node-id%3D49%253A365%26" allowfullscreen></iframe>

			<div class="body-text">I used Maze to conduct rounds of usability testing. The tasks were
                as follows:
                <ol>
                <li>Turn on Dark Mode.</li>
                <li>Add a new shelf and title it, "Wishlist".</li>
                <li>Search for The Hobbit and add it to the shelf, "To Read".</li>
                <li>Edit the typo in the first note for the book, Educated.</li>
                <li>Add a "Memoir" tag to Educated.</li>
                </ol>
			</div>

            <div class="body-text">Overall, it seemed that users became more comfortable with the layout of the prototype as
                the usability study continued. I compiled a summary of feedback from specific user comments as well as user
                reports and heatmaps. I also included solutions to minimize pain points in the next iteration of this prototype.</div>

                <li>Swiping/dragging option in onboarding pages was less intuitive than tapping. Users tried tapping on the page indicators
                    at the bottom or around the page.
                    <div><b>SOLUTION: Add multiple prototype flow options to access next pages.</b></div></li>
                <li>Option to edit text was misleading. Users had some trouble trying to edit by selecting the text itself.
                    <div><b>SOLUTION: Create multiple flows to edit text fields by selecting the text itself.
                    </b></div>
                </li>
            
			<div></div>
			<div></div>  

            <!-- TAPPING HEATMAP -->

			</div>        
            
            <div></div>
			<div></div>

                <li>New shelf addition path had too many screens. Users were confused about where to add a new shelf, and
                    many had indirect success with the task, accessing an average of four incorrect pages before
                    following the expected path.

                    <div><b>SOLUTION: Add CTA buttons at earlier screens.</b></div></li>
      
            <!-- SHELF ADDITION PATH -->

			<div></div>
			<div></div>

            <div class="header-text">Second Iteration and Feedback</div>
            <div class="body-text">More intuitive changes were made for swiping and scrolling for the onboarding pages and
                open text fields. A large change for this iteration was the reduction of the number of taps to reach
                destinations. For both shelf and book addition, I reduced the extra taps by including CTA buttons in the
                main bookshelf page. This prototype is still optimized for user testing, again giving feedback when tasks
                are completed.</div>
