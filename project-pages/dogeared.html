			<div class="header-text">Project Background and Overview</div>
			<div class="body-text">I really enjoy reading, and I wanted to create a simple mobile app that
                can easily organize books into a combined virtual bookshelf and journal.
			</div>
            <div class="body-text">The purpose of this project is primarily to explore higher level interactive and responsive Figma
				prototyping and serve as an exercise in conducting usability studies.
			</div>

			<div></div>
			<div></div>

			<div class="header-text">Understanding Users</div>

			<div class="subheader-text">Qualitative Competitive Analysis</div>
			<div class="body-text">I conducted a competitive analysis of similar library management and reading tracker applications,
                including Bookshelf, libib, BookBuddy, and Goodreads.
			</div>
            <div class="body-text">As an overview, the key feature that direct competitors offered was the option of adding books to a
                list, using barcode scanning, manual searching or adding, and ISBN lookup. Other features across the both indirect and
                direct competitors included reviews, book and genre recommendations, and wishlists.
			</div>
            <div class="body-text">From these audits, I narrowed down two features to highlight in this design:
                <li>Personal Tags</li>
                <li>Custom Annotations/Notes</li>
			</div>

			<div></div>
			<div></div>

			<div class="header-text">UX Concept Design</div>
            <div class="subheader-text">Wireframing</div>

			<div class="body-text">I created hand drawn wireframes that served as a reference for the first iteration of a low fidelity
                prototype. It includes a bookshelf and expanded shelf section, a search function, settings, and various features in a
                book overview screen.
			</div>

			<!-- WIREFRAME -->

			</div>

			<div></div>
			<div></div>

			<div class="header-text">Prototyping and Testing</div>
            <div class="body-text">I conducted a round of usability testing and three iterations of prototypes, developing more
				comprehensive prototyping and creating possible solutions to pain points that I discovered at every step. Both
				iterations were tested by different users.</div>

            <div class="header-text">First Iteration</div>

			<!-- FIRST LOFI -->
			<div id="project-gallery">
				<div class="project-gallery-content">
					<div class="gallery-image-container">
						<img src="../assets/images/dogeared/first-prototype.png" class="gallery-image">
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div></div>
			<div></div>

			<div class="body-text">Above is the basic layout of the wireframe as a base. The first iteration includes basic
                prototyped animations and flows, optimized for testing by providing feedback when specific tasks are completed.
			</div>

			<div class="body-text">I used Maze to conduct rounds of usability testing. The tasks were
                as follows:
                <ol>
                <li>Turn on Dark Mode.</li>
                <li>Add a new shelf and title it, "Wishlist".</li>
                <li>Search for The Hobbit and add it to the shelf, "To Read".</li>
                <li>Edit the typo in the first note for the book, Educated.</li>
                <li>Add a "Memoir" tag to Educated.</li>
                </ol>
			</div>

            <div class="body-text">Overall, it seemed that users became more comfortable with the layout of the prototype as
                the usability study continued. I compiled a summary of feedback from specific user comments as well as user
                reports and heatmaps. I also included solutions to minimize pain points in the next iteration of this prototype.</div>

                <li>Swiping/dragging option in onboarding pages was less intuitive than tapping. Users tried tapping on the page indicators
                    at the bottom or around the page.
                    <div><b>SOLUTION: Add multiple prototype flow options to access next pages.</b></div></li>
                <li>Option to edit text was misleading. Users had some trouble trying to edit by selecting the text itself.
                    <div><b>SOLUTION: Create multiple flows to edit text fields by selecting the text itself.
                    </b></div>
                </li>
            
			<div></div>
			<div></div>

            <div></div>
			<div></div>

                <li>New shelf addition path had too many screens. Users were confused about where to add a new shelf, and
                    many had indirect success with the task, accessing an average of four incorrect pages before
                    following the expected path.

                    <div><b>SOLUTION: Add CTA buttons at earlier screens.</b></div></li>

            <div class="header-text">Second Iteration</div>
            <div class="body-text">This iteration is focused on responding to the user testing feedback as well as improving
				accessibility in the layout.</div>

			<div class="body-text"><b>Swiping and Scrolling</b> - I included more tapping options for prototype flows in the onboarding
				pages and open text fields.</div>
			<div class="body-text"><b>Number of Taps</b> - For both shelf and book addition, I reduced the extra taps by including
				CTA buttons in the main bookshelf page, eliminating the need to access these buttons in later screens.</div>
			<div class="body-text"><b>Readability</b> - To avoid only relying on book cover information, I enlarged the book covers
				and included titles and authors on the bookshelf page for more accessibility. Changes were also made to implement an
				information hierarchy to draw the eye towards certain shelves and reduce cognitive load.</div>

            <div class="header-text">Third Iteration</div>
			<div class="body-text">The third prototype revision focuses primarily on coloring, graphics, and text.
			</div>

			<div class="body-text"><b>Color and Contrast</b> - I developed a UI style kit with a readable color palette, ensuring that
				it follows the WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast requirements.</div>
			<div class="body-text"><b>Graphics and Images</b> - I added visuals to improve onboarding and the overall application
				experience.</div>
			<div class="body-text"><b>Typography</b> - I implemented more real-world information in the prototype and outlined a
				typography hierarchy for better info organization.

            <div class="header-text">Reflections and Future Considerations</div>
			<div class="body-text">I was very satisfied with my goal of getting a more in-depth experience with Figma prototyping
				and Maze usability testing. I wish I could have used some Figma features more extensively, like variants, plugins,
				and generated code snippets that are very useful in translating work to developers.
			</div>

			<div class="body-text">It was very useful to divide up prototyping into three sections, since each iteration could focus
				on different aspects of the application's design. Attempting to fix all the issues that I discovered in only a single
				test would have been a lot more difficult.
			</div>

			<div class="body-text">While this application design is fairly minimal, there are a lot of other features that I would
				love to include if I were to continue working on this design project in the future, including in depth reading
				statistics, custom book recommendations, or visual personalizations.
