			<div></div>

			<div class="header-text">Project Background and Overview</div>
			<div class="body-text">I joined a two day designathon from UX Scene in a team of four
					to create a mobile app design and prototype. The designathon journey began with initial
					mobile app ideas geared towards making the airport check-in process easier and more
					accessible. We began with goal sprints, then moved to user research, worked on individual
					wireframes, and finally completed several rounds of prototypes.

			<div class="subheader-text">What's the Problem?</div>
			<div class="body-text">The elderly typically experience a technological disconnect during commercial
					air travel, and users over the age of 65 often have a harder time navigating the airline check-in
					process and airports in general. We wanted to create a solution with a mobile application design
					that would make this easier and more intuitive for older individuals as well as those that travel
					often.
			</div>

			<div></div>
			<div></div>

			<div class="header-text">Research and Understanding Users</div>

			<div class="subheader-text">User Flow and Surveys</div>
			<div class="body-text">We explored the typical user flow of a person navigating an airport and making
					their way on board a plane. After sending out a questionnaire answered by over 50 individuals, I
					compiled the results to discover several pain points and typical issues that airport goers often
					ran into.
			</div>
			
			<!-- SURVEY RESULTS -->
			<div id="project-gallery">
				<div class="project-gallery-content">

					<div class="gallery-image-container half-width">

					<div class="gallery-image-container half-width">
						<img src="../assets/images/airfair/survey2.png" class="gallery-image">
					</div>

				</div>
			</div>

			<div></div>
			<div></div>

			<div class="subheader-text">Pain Points</div>
			<div class="body-text">People found that locating gates and figuring out general airport directions was
				difficult. Preparing documents and conducting pre-boarding activities was also particularly tedious.
				Another issue was having too many apps and places to find this information.
			</div>

			<div></div>
			<div></div>

			<div class="subheader-text">Personas</div>
			<div class="body-text">We created two personas for this design, based on user responses to the survey.
			</div>

			<!-- PERSONAS -->
			<div id="project-gallery">

			<div></div>

			<div class="header-text">Refining the Design</div>

			<div class="subheader-text">Wireframes</div>
			<div class="body-text">In my team, we spent time creating our own wireframes over two rounds of feedback.
			My drafts are below.
			</div>

			<!-- WIREFRAMES -->
			<div id="project-gallery">
				<div class="project-gallery-content">
					<div class="gallery-image-container">

					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div></div>
			<div></div>

			<div class="body-text">After compiling our wireframes, we refined our ideas to four main concepts that we
				wanted our application design to include:
				<li>Landing page with different login options</li>
				<li>Travel wallet with all documents needed for airport travel</li>
				<li>Stored boarding passes</li>
				<li>Main menu with navigation options</li>
			</div>

			<div></div>
			<div></div>

			<div class="header-text">Lo-fi Prototype</div>

			<!-- LOFI -->

				</div>
			</div>

			<div></div>
			<div></div>

			<div class="subheader-text">Usability Studies</div>
			<div class="body-text">Using Maze, we tested the user flow of our lo-fi prototype with three users that
				fit our primary demographic (60+ year olds that found airport travel difficult). I compiled the information
				we gathered from the platform to gain insight on the accessibility of our design. Users appreciated the big
				lettering and that it was easy to read. Users wanted to feel as if they were making progress while accessing
				information and also wanted icons that made more sense and were more intuitive.

			<div class="header-text">Reflections and Future Considerations</div>
			<div class="body-text">This was the first UX Design project I had the opportunity to work on, and I learned a
				lot about the UX Design process from it. From this two day event, I learned how to better navigate Figma and
				work with experienced individuals in the industry.
			</div>
			<div class="body-text">Given more time, I would like to further explore the user research component in more depth
				by running interviews and conducting more usability studies between each redesign level of prototyping. We did
				run into challenges in that aspect given that we could only retrieve responses for surveys from that weekend.
			</div>
			<div class="body-text">While this was only a design mockup, I would be interested in continuing this project or a
				similar one to add some backend and expand on accessibility options for specific phone models.
			</div>
			<div class="body-text">Feel free to check out the original project post on Devpost below, or see the prototype and
				slide deck above.
