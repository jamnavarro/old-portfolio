        <div class="header-text">Project Background and Overview</div>
        <div class="body-text">As a college student, I usually use online platforms to communicate questions, discussions,
          and clarifications with professors and teaching assistants. Piazza is the one that I use most often on my desktop.
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">Piazza is a learning management system that can act as a forum for students to discuss course
          content with instructors and peers. Over the past few years, I have used this platform in seven semester-long classes.
          My experience has not been as smooth as I hoped; I continuously found their website difficult to navigate and get
          accustomed to, and have only just recently discovered some of their genuinely useful features. I wanted to explore a
          redesigned UI for their website, in order to make it easier for students like me to use Piazza and what it has to offer. 
        </div>

        <div class="subheader-text">Defining the Issue</div>
        <div class="body-text">The Piazza online platform is at times difficult to use, and their features are not well displayed
          to a user. Sometimes this is the main form of communication between students and those that can help them in a course,
          and an inaccessible display has the possibility of making a student's experience contacting professors or TAs undesirable,
          or even causing them to avoid it altogether.
        </div>

        <div class="subheader-text">What's the Goal?</div>
        <div class="body-text">I hope to redesign the Piazza online interface from the student's perspective in order to make it
          easier to get help and share knowledge, and make features more accessible to the end users: students, professors, and assistants.
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">TO BE CONTINUED!</div>
